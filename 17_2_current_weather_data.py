# 17.3 Current weather data

# This nested dictionary is from OpenWeather API
# most APIs return something data that looks like this
# (in JavaScript this format is called JSON)
# when you get to I211, you'll learn how to scrape the web and get data from APIs
# in the I399 JavaScript course, you'll work with APIs, maybe even this one
# For I210, we're just going to give you some data as an example to practice with:
# if you want the current weather for IU, you can regrab here:
# https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=47405&appid=bbaf86cac3c0e62ef035b4a051fdf664

# (1) Print in a user friendly way -- what are the keys?
print("\nWeather data options:")

# this is in Kelvin - convert to both Fahrenheit and Celsius and label
