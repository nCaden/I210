# 9.1 Counting coins
import random  # you'll need random for this exercise

# SET-UP
types_of_coins = ["penny", "nickel", "dime", "quarter"]
change = []
counted_coins = {}

# CREATE A CUP FULL OF CHANGE (create the input)
# randomly create a list of coins to represent your PizzaX cup full of change




# COUNT HOW MANY COINS OF EACH TYPE (process the data)





# (3) CALCULATE THE MONETARY VALUE (calculate and output)
# use code to answer these questions
# Q: What is the monetary value of each type of coin?
# e.g. if I have 3 dimes, I have $0.30 in dimes
# Q: What is the total amount of money in the change cup?
